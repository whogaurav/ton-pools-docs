# No-Loss Prize-Linked Staking

No-Loss Prize-Linked Staking is the core concept behind TON Pools. It combines the security of traditional savings with the excitement of prize draws.

## How It Works

1. **Deposit**: Users deposit their TON into a pool.
2. **Staking**: The pooled TON is staked with validators on the TON blockchain.
3. **Yield Generation**: Staking generates yield over time.
4. **Prize Pool Formation**: The yield forms the prize pool.
5. **Regular Draws**: Weekly draws distribute prizes to lucky winners.
6. **No Loss of Principal**: Users can withdraw their original deposits at any time.
