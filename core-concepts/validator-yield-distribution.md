# Validator Yield Distribution

The validator yield is a crucial component of TON Pools' prize-linked savings model. Here's how it works and how it's distributed:

## Yield Generation

1. **Staking**: TON deposited by users is staked with validators on the TON network.
2. **Validation**: Validators participate in block production and transaction validation.
3. **Rewards**: The network rewards validators for their work with new TON coins.
4. **Yield**: These rewards constitute the yield, which is then distributed.

## Prize Pool Allocation

The prize pool portion of the yield is further divided:

- **Weekly Prizes (80%)**: Distributed through regular weekly draws.
- **Special Events (15%)**: Reserved for special promotional events and larger, less frequent draws.
- **Community Initiatives (5%)**: Allocated for community-driven projects and governance decisions.
