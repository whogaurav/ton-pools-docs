# What is TON Pools

TON Pools is a decentralised application (dapp) built on the TON Blockchain that revolutionizes the concept of savings and staking in the crypto world. Our platform introduces prize-linked savings accounts to the TON ecosystem, allowing users to stake their TON coins and participate in exciting prize draws without risking their principal investment.

## Key Concepts

1. **No-Loss Prize Pools**: Users deposit their TON into pools, which are then staked with validators. The staking rewards form the prize pool.
2. **Weekly Prize Draws**: Regular opportunities to win from the accumulated staking rewards.
3. **Community Focus**: Built-in features to foster a vibrant, engaged community of savers and crypto enthusiasts.
4. **Telegram Integration**: Seamless interaction with the popular messaging platform, making it easy for users to participate and stay updated.

By combining the security of blockchain technology with the excitement of prize draws, TON Pools aims to make saving and staking more engaging and rewarding for everyone in the TON ecosystem.
