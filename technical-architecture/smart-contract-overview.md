# Smart Contract Overview

TON Pools relies on a suite of smart contracts to manage deposits, staking, prize distributions, and other core functionalities. Here's an overview of our smart contract architecture:

## Core Contracts

1. **Pool Manager Contract**
   * Manages the creation and configuration of prize pools
   * Handles deposits and withdrawals
   * Interfaces with the Staking Contract
2. **Staking Contract**
   * Interacts with TON validators
   * Manages the staking and unstaking of TON
   * Collects and distributes staking rewards
3. **Prize Distribution Contract**
   * Implements the verifiable random function (VRF) for winner selection
   * Manages prize pool accumulation and distribution
   * Handles different prize structures for various pools
4. **User Account Contract**
   * Manages user balances and participation across multiple pools
   * Handles user-specific settings and preferences
5. **Governance Contract** (for future implementation)
   * Will handle protocol upgrades and parameter changes
   * Will manage community voting on proposed changes

## Contract Interactions

* The Pool Manager Contract acts as the primary interface for user interactions
* It communicates with other contracts to execute various functions
* All inter-contract communications are secured and verified on-chain

* Contract addresses are published and verifiable on-chain
* Key contract interactions are emitted as events for easy tracking and verification
