#### **Participating in Prize Draws**

Once you’ve deposited TON, you are automatically entered into regular prize draws. Here’s everything you need to know:

***

**How It Works**

* **Automatic Entry**: Every TON you deposit counts as entries into the prize draws. The more TON you deposit, the more entries you receive, increasing your chances of winning.
* **Draw Frequency**: Most pools feature weekly draws, though some special pools may have different frequencies (e.g., daily, monthly). Check your specific pool's schedule in the pool details.

#### Winning Mechanics

1. **Fair and Transparent Selection**\
   Winners are determined through a random number generated on-chain, ranging between 0 and `totalPerSecUserDeposit`. This ensures a transparent and fair selection process.
2. **Prize Calculation and Distribution**\
   The winning number is published on-chain, and the prize amount—calculated as 3% of `totalPerSecUserDeposit`—is credited to the winner’s TON Pools account. Winners can choose to reinvest their winnings in another pool or withdraw them at any time.

**Maximising Your Chances to Win**

1. **Deposit More TON**: Your odds of winning are proportional to the amount of TON you deposit. Consider increasing your deposit to improve your chances.
2. **Stay Deposited Longer**: Some pools offer bonus entries for longer deposit periods. Check your pool’s terms for any loyalty bonuses that may apply.
3. **Diversify Across Pools**: Spread your deposits across multiple pools to diversify your chances. Different pools may have varying odds and prize structures.
4. **Look for Special Events**: Watch for special promotional draws with larger prize pools, which may offer better odds or bigger prizes.

**Checking Results**

* **Real-Time Updates**: Results are typically announced immediately after each draw. Check the "Results" section of your dashboard to see if you’ve won.
* **Enable Notifications**: Turn on notifications to receive instant updates about your wins and other important events.

_Remember, even if you don’t win, your principal remains safe and continues to generate entries for future draws. Every draw brings a new opportunity to win!_
